```
> bin/plugin devtools newtheme
Enter Theme Name: MyTheme
Enter Theme Description: My New Custom Theme

Please choose a template type
  [pure-blank ] Basic Theme using Pure.css

  [copy       ] Copy another theme
 > pure-blank

SUCCESS theme mytheme -> Created Successfully

Path: /home/johnnyr/webroot/grav-installation/user/themes/mytheme
```

There are **three template creation options**

1. `pure-blank` - This is a very basic blank theme that uses the [Pure CSS framework](http://purecss.io/)
2. `inheritance` - This creates a very basic template with minimal files that inherits a base theme.  To find out more about theme inheritance, [check out the subject in more details on the Grav Learn site](https://learn.getgrav.org/themes/customization#theme-inheritance).
3. 'copy' - This allows you to create a new theme based on an existing theme.  This is the simplest way to get started with a new theme by using another theme as the basis.
